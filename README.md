# Teddy Swims – Bad Dreams

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Sun is goin' down
time is runnin' out
No one else around but me
Steady losing line,
steady losing my mind
Over shadows
and grind my teeth, ooh
Without you, there ain't
no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way
I could sleep tonight
What I'd do for a little bit
of peace and quiet
Without you, I keep
Slipping into bad dreams
(Bad dreams)
Where there's no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you
to set me free
From all of these bad dreams
(Bad dreams)
Waitin' on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you
to set me free
From all of these, all of these
Ooh
Bad dreams
Ooh
All of these
Baby, please come around,
help me settle down
Heavy head's the crown
in my head, yeah
What you waiting for?
Something physical?
I can do this by myself
Without you, there ain't
no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way
I could sleep tonight
What I'd do for a little bit
of peace and quiet
Without you, I keep
Slipping into bad dreams
Where there's no you and I
(And I)
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you
to set me free (Set me free)
From all of these (All of these)
bad dreams (Bad dreams)
Waitin' on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you
to set me free (Set me free)
From all of these, all of these
Ooh
Bad dreams (Bad dreams)
Baby, please
Ooh
All of these (Baby, please)
All of these
